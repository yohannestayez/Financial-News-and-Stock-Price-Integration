The goal is to understand how news sentiment affects stock prices and to identify significant trends and events. The analysis involves a rigorous sentimental and correlation analysis of the financial news dataset.

### Notebooks:
1. Task1: Descriptive Statics, Text analysis (Sentiment analysis & Topic Modeling), Time Series Analysis, Publisher Analysis
2. Task2: Quantitative analysis using pynance and TA-Lib

## Notebooks

Task1
   - This notebook covers 
    1. Descriptive Statistics:
-  To Obtain basic statistics for textual lengths (like headline length).
-  Count the number of articles per publisher to identify which publishers are most active.
-  Analyze the publication dates to see trends over time, such as increased news frequency on particular days or during specific events.
2. Text Analysis(Sentiment analysis & Topic Modeling):
-  Perform sentiment analysis on headlines to gauge the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) associated with the news.
-  Use natural language processing to identify common keywords or phrases, potentially extracting topics or significant events (like "FDA approval", "price target", etc.).
3. Time Series Analysis:
-  Analyzes the publication frequency over time.
-  Check for spikes in article publications related to specific market events.
4. Publisher Analysis:
-  Checks which publishers contribute most to the news feed and check the difference in the type of news they report.
-  Identify unique domains to see if certain organizations contribute more frequently.

Task2
-This notebook will cover the quantitative analysis on the historic data using pynance and TA-Lib
